Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.
 State refresh removed for brevity
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place
-/+ destroy and then create replacement
+/- create replacement and then destroy
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.eks.module.eks.random_pet.workers_launch_template[12] must be replaced
+/- resource "random_pet" "workers_launch_template" {
      ~ id        = "living-mink" -> (known after apply)
      ~ keepers   = {
          - "lt_name" = "application-image-processing-ondemand-020210602151433813100000003-1"
        } -> (known after apply) # forces replacement
        length    = 2
        separator = "-"
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on .terraform/modules/bim_processing_scheduler_namespace/modules/namespace/namespace.tf line 2, in locals:
   2:   namespace           = "${var.app}"

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

(and 21 more similar warnings elsewhere)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
